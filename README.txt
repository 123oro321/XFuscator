XFuscator - The Best Lua Obfuscator 3V4R
----------------------------------------

Disclaimer:
Might not actually be the best one ever. 
If you find a better one, tell me so I can make XFuscator better than it.


Features:
- Remove comments
- Rename ALL local variables SAFELY
- extract & encode strings
- Remove extra whitespace
- Add fluff
- precompile with loadstring
- encode source (or binary chunk)
TODO:
- Add ROBLOX features to make the game crash if the script was stolen
- Add unrepresentable characters in comments
- Encrypt?


NOTE: Files become much larger. A 1KB file can easily go to 5-9 KB.
XFuscator (about 10 KB) becomes ~200 KB
